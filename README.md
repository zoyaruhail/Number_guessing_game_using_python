How the Game Works 🕹️


The player is presented with a menu:

1. Start → Begins the game.

2. Exit → Ends the game and displays the final scores.

If the player chooses Start, the game will:


Generate a random number between 0 and 10.


Ask the player to guess the number.

Compare the player's guess with the generated number.
Scoring System:

❌ Incorrect Guess → Computer gains 1 point.

After each round, the player is asked:


"Do you want to play again?"

Typing "yes" → Restarts the game with a new number.
